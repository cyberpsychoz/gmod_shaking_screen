# Garry's mod shaking screen on J

This script hooks into the "Think" function, which is called every frame in Garry's Mod. It checks if the player is alive and the "J" key is being pressed, and if both conditions are true, it executes the "pp_mat_overlay urinal" console command. This console command applies a screen-pulling effect to the game.

Note that this script is just a simple example and there may be more robust and efficient ways to achieve the same effect.
At any time, you can simply change the trigger of the action.
